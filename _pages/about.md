I am a Ph.D. candidate at School of Biological Science & Medical Engineering, Southeast University.
<!-- Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. Degree from University of Munich in 2022, advised by xxx. -->
My research goal is to understand the dynamic of complex systems more effectively by combining known information (prior knowledge, mathematical or physical equations, etc.) with data-driven methods.
I am interested in Physics-guide deep learning, dynamic model, and Bayesian inference.

Recent News
======
Currently, I am looking for a postdoc position.

Research Interests
======
* Physics-data-driven model
* Infectious disease transmission modelling
* Parameter estimation in stochastic mathematical mode
* Information extraction and knowledge graph

Ongoing projcet
------
* Bayesian physics-informed neural networks for infectious disease transmission modelling.
* Biomeidcal information extraction from unstructed text.
