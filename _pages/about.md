<!-- <span style="color:red;">
Lecturer, China Pharmaceutical University
</span> -->

I am a lecturer at the School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University.
Prior to that, I received Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Southeast University in 2023, supervised by Prof. Feng Chen and Prof. Xiao Sun.

My research goal is to understand the dynamic of complex biological systems more effectively by combining known information (prior knowledge, mathematical or physical equations, etc.) with data-driven methods.
My research interests lies in :
* Pharmacokinetics
* Physics-data-driven model
* Infectious disease transmission modelling
* Information extraction and knowledge graph
