<span style="color:red;">Currently, I am looking for a Postdoc position. </span>

I have abtained Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Southeast University, supervised by Professor Feng Chen.
My research goal is to understand the dynamic of complex systems more effectively by combining known information (prior knowledge, mathematical or physical equations, etc.) with data-driven methods.
<!-- Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. Degree from University of Munich in 2022, advised by xxx. -->
<!-- I am interested in Physics-guide deep learning, dynamic model, and Bayesian inference. -->
My research interests lies in :
* Physics-data-driven model
* Infectious disease transmission modelling
* Parameter estimation in stochastic mathematical mode
* Information extraction and knowledge graph
