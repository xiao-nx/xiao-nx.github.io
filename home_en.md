## 🔍 About Me  

I am a Lecturer at the School of Science, China Pharmaceutical University. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Southeast University (Dec. 2023), under the supervision of **Prof. Feng Chen** and **Prof. Xiao Sun**. My research focuses on combining **domain knowledge** (e.g., physics, mathematics) with **data-driven approaches** to model and analyze complex biological systems more effectively.  

My research interests include:  

- **Pharmacokinetics**  
- **Physics-informed modeling**  
- **Infectious disease transmission modeling**  
- **Information extraction & knowledge graph**
